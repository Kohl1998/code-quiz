# code quiz

## Description

For this application I built a web page with a code quiz, that presents user with a selection of questions, where they have to select the correct option.

If the wrong option is selected, the timer drops 10 seconds to penalise the user. However, if the correct option is selected, the user's score increments as a reward. 

For this project I was provided with starter code that included HTML/CSS, so all I had to do was create three seperate script files that handles the questions, logic, and user score.  

During the process I learnt that I still have so much to improve including my logical thinking when trackling a problem. 

One thing to mention is that the project is not completed; I just wanted to update the README to give other developers context on the project. 

There are a few things that I need to twerk such as the answers within the logic file, so there is one correct option. Also, need to complete the highscore js file, so the user can enter their initials, to record their data. 

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code, but also see the code in action using the live server extension. 

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.

## Features

For this application the user has to select the correct option within the quiz to collect points. Also, once the quiz is over, the user gets the option to enter their initials, and view their highscore. 

In additional to the last point, the user can restart the quiz to play again.
